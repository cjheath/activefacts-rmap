# Activefacts::Rmap

This gem provides a relational mapping that generates 5NF relation schemas
for a fact model in ActiveFacts. Usually the model will have been compiled
from a Constellation Query Language (CQL) source file or loaded from an ORM
file. The code is tested in dependent gems that use this gem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'activefacts-rmap'
```

## Usage

Check out the activefacts-examples tests for API usage, or just use the
acticefacts-generators to generate SQL, Rails, or other relational code.
